# Type Canonicalization Reboot – Plan 5

## Project Goal
Deliver a robust, maintainable type system for Voyd’s hybrid nominal + structural language. The pipeline must compile programs like `test.voyd` without illegal casts, even when unions span recursive object graphs or mix nominal and structural variants.

## Background
- The previous “Phase 5 incomplete” commit (`e6bb294fb646bc0a92160d5a9797ebe2a57aeebe`) injected aggressive canonicalization/metadata rewrites across codegen and semantics; those changes correlate with Binaryen traps (`Assertion failed: isRef()`) and invalid wasm modules (`ref.cast` mismatches).
- `canonicalizeResolvedTypes` currently mutates the AST after resolution, but never converges—new `Some#…` / `Map#…` clones appear faster than the pass can normalize them, and codegen re-registers the losers.
- Optional constructor audits (`npx tsx scripts/inspect-optional-constructors.ts`) still report 12 distinct `Some` heap types plus 1 `None`, showing canonical Optional instances fragment.
- Union lowering relies on compiling every union arm to the base object type (`$Object#16`). The wasm text for `test.voyd` (`vt --emit-wasm-text --opt test.voyd`) demonstrates repeated `struct.new $Some#144054#13`/`ref.cast` sequences, so any lapse in canonical identities produces the illegal casts we observe.
- End-to-end coverage (`map-recursive-union.e2e.test.ts`, `run-wasm-regression.e2e.test.ts`) fails hard; we need to pin these failures before refactoring.

## Guiding Principles
- **Roll back first.** Remove the `e6bb294fb646` changes (especially AST mutation and codegen cache hacks) before building new infrastructure.
- **Lock regressions in tests.** Create north-star fixtures—including two structurally identical recursive types plus a third overlapping union variant—to document the failure and track progress with `test.skip`/`test.todo`.
- **Intern types at creation.** Replace post-hoc canonicalization with a global interner powered by `typeKey`, similar to Rust’s `TyCtxt` or TypeScript’s checker pools.
- **Metadata belongs to canonicals.** Binaryen caches, trait lookup tables, and generic instance lists must live on canonical handles only.
- **Deterministic wasm is non-negotiable.** Each phase should preserve or improve determinism in emitted wasm text; the union lowering must no longer produce divergent heap ids for identical payload shapes.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0 – Roll Back Regression Commit
- **Goal:** Remove the high-risk changes introduced in `e6bb294fb646` and restore the pre-phase-5 baseline.
- **Work:**
  1. Delete or revert the diffs under `src/codegen.ts`, `src/codegen/compile-call.ts`, `src/codegen/compile-closure.ts`, `src/codegen/rtt/method-accessor.ts`, and `src/semantics/types/canonicalize.ts` introduced by that commit.
  2. Update any headers/docs referencing the experimental behaviour.
  3. Confirm `npm test` matches the earlier failure pattern (Binaryen trap + wasm validator errors) so we know we are back to the previous baseline.
- **Deliverables:** Clean worktree without the regression code, notes added to `docs/type-canonicalization-phase7-investigation.md`.

### Phase 1 – Baseline Snapshot & Union Audit
- **Goal:** Capture the exact failure state (post-rollback) and inspect union lowering.
- **Work:**
  - Run `npx vitest run src/__tests__/map-recursive-union.e2e.test.ts` and `npx vitest run src/__tests__/run-wasm-regression.e2e.test.ts`; document stack traces, optional constructor counts, and wasm validation errors under a “Phase 1 Baseline” entry in `docs/type-canonicalization-phase7-investigation.md`.
  - Emit wasm text with `vt --emit-wasm-text --opt test.voyd`; summarize the union lowering pattern (top-level `$Object#16`, multiple `Some#…` heap ids, repeated `ref.cast` checks) in both the investigation doc and `docs/type-canonicalization-pass.md`.
  - Hash or otherwise record the relevant wasm text fragments for future comparisons.
- **Deliverables:** Updated docs with the baseline and union audit, no code edits beyond instrumentation toggles.

### Phase 2 – Lock Guiding North-Star Tests
- **Goal:** Encode today’s failures as explicit regression tests, then skip them with TODOs so future phases re-enable them deliberately.
- **Work:**
  1. Introduce a dedicated fixture exercising:
     - Two structurally identical recursive types.
     - A third recursive union that overlaps with the first two but adds an extra object arm.
     - A runtime scenario matching `test.voyd` (map literal, match, optional unwrap).
  2. Extend `src/__tests__/map-recursive-union.e2e.test.ts` (or add a sibling suite) to run the new fixture and assert on:
     - Canonical identity (currently failing).
     - Wasm execution (currently failing).
     - Optional constructor counts.
  3. Wrap failing assertions in `test.skip` / `test.todo` with comments referencing the phase responsible for re-enabling them.
  4. Add snapshots (or golden summaries) for union lowering so future phases can diff wasm payloads deterministically.
- **Deliverables:** New fixtures/tests committed, failures recorded via skipped tests, all suites still pass overall.

### Phase 3 – Remove Post-Hoc Mutation Pass
- **Goal:** Convert `canonicalizeResolvedTypes` into a pure validator and delete mutation-specific plumbing.
- **Work:**
  1. Strip metadata rewrites (`adoptObjectMetadata`, orphan snapshots, `clearTypeCaches`, iteration loops) from `canonicalize-resolved-types.ts`.
  2. Update consumers (`processSemantics`, debug helpers) to treat canonicalization as an optional validation step.
  3. Delete dead helpers/utilities now unused after the rollback.
  4. Ensure `CANON_DEBUG` instrumentation remains available but read-only.
  5. Refresh docs describing the canonicalization pass to emphasize its new “validate only” role.
- **Deliverables:** Lean validator pass, code references cleaned, documentation updated.

### Phase 4 – Standalone Type Interner & Coverage
- **Goal:** Deliver a production-ready interner module plus exhaustive tests—unit and e2e—that exercise it with real Voyd programs while keeping it isolated from the main pipeline.
- **Work:**
  1. Implement a `TypeInterner` (or revamped `TypeStore`) keyed by `typeKey` fingerprints with cycle-aware storage, keeping the API free of any legacy mutation hooks.
  2. Build a thin test harness that instantiates the interner alongside today’s resolver so unit tests can assert canonical identity without touching codegen.
  3. Add rich coverage: unit tests for structural/recursive reuse and an e2e fixture that drives `vt --run` against a real `.voyd` module compiled with the experimental interner, capturing canonicalization stats as artifacts.
  4. Document the interner’s data model and invariants in `docs/type-canonicalization-pass.md`, including guidance for future debugging hooks.
- **Deliverables:** Interner module, accompanying harness, green unit tests, and e2e coverage demonstrating deterministic canonical handles.

### Phase 5 – Transition Wiring & Feature Flag
- **Goal:** Thread the interner through the existing semantics pipeline behind an opt-in flag so we can validate behaviour without destabilizing current builds.
- **Work:**
  1. Introduce injectable factories (e.g. `createTypeContext({ useInterner })`) so every type construction site can choose between the legacy clones and the new interner.
  2. Ensure all creation points (objects, unions, optionals, traits, inference) call the interner when the flag is enabled, while preserving the current default.
  3. Add dual-run diagnostics that compare old/new handles, logging divergences and heap-id reuse metrics for the investigation doc.
  4. Extend the vitest suites to execute critical scenarios (including the new e2e fixture) in both modes, skipping only the assertions that still require full integration.
- **Deliverables:** Feature-flagged wiring with parity telemetry, updated tests running in legacy and interner modes, documentation on how to toggle the flag.

### Phase 5.5 – Alias Finalization & Interner Synchronization
- **Goal:** Remove the “skip unresolved aliases” guard by ensuring placeholder `TypeAlias` nodes only hit the interner after their `.type` field is populated, so generic inference keeps lexical aliases while canonical handles converge deterministically.
- **Work:**
  1. **Defer alias registration.** Stop passing freshly minted inference aliases (`resolve-object-type`, `resolve-fn`, `resolve-trait`, `init-entities`, etc.) through `registerTypeInstance` at creation time. Hold them in place until inference or resolution assigns a concrete `type`.
  2. **Re-intern on resolution.** Once an alias receives a real target, immediately hand it to the active type context (e.g. `context.register(alias)`) so the interner maps the alias fingerprint to its canonical payload. Ensure aliases created pre-Phase 5 remain untouched when the flag is off.
  3. **Track pending placeholders.** Extend the type context to keep a lightweight table of unresolved aliases keyed by lexical id. When `.type` transitions from `undefined` to a concrete `Type`, re-run interning so the placeholder collapses to the canonical target. Fingerprint unresolved aliases by `(alias.id, alias.name)` purely for collision detection—never substitute them before they complete.
  4. **Update inference paths.** Audit generic specialization helpers (`resolveGenericsWithTypeArgs`, trait impl registration, iterator construction) to call the new “alias resolved” hook right after filling `.type`. Add regression coverage that toggles `VOYD_USE_TYPE_INTERNER=1` for the inference kitchen-sink suite and ArrayIterator pathways.
- **Deliverables:** Interner-compatible alias lifecycle with no recursion guards, telemetry confirming aliases converge to canonical targets, and tests exercising ArrayIterator / generic inference in both legacy and interner modes.

### Phase 6 – Activate the Interner & Consolidate Metadata
- **Goal:** Make the interner the default, remove the legacy cloning path, and ensure every semantic metadata table hangs off canonical handles.
- **Work:**
  1. Flip the feature flag, delete the clone-based constructors, and remove `ObjectType.clone`’s `#iteration` suffix so duplicates can no longer materialize.
  2. Redirect `registerGenericInstance`, trait caches, and optional constructor bookkeeping to the interner; clear out any loser-specific cache stores.
  3. Update diagnostics and tooling (`inspect-optional-constructors`, CANON_DEBUG readouts) to assert canonical ownership invariants.
  4. Lock in tests that assert `genericParent.genericInstances` and related registries only contain canonical references.
  5. Refresh design docs to describe the new default flow and any migration hooks that remain.
- **Deliverables:** Interner-enabled semantics with canonical-only metadata, feature flag removed, comprehensive tests covering canonical ownership.

### Phase 7 – Align Codegen With Canonical Handles
- **Goal:** Ensure codegen consumes canonical types exclusively and no longer introduces divergent heap ids.
- **Work:**
  1. Remove `ensureCanonicalObjectInstance`/trait equivalents and rely on interner-produced handles.
  2. Simplify `mapBinaryenType` caching; fix union lowering so identical payload shapes share heap ids.
  3. Re-run optional constructor audits, capturing expected counts in tests.
  4. Confirm emitting wasm twice from the same module yields identical type/function sets.
- **Deliverables:** Simplified codegen, deterministic wasm output, updated regression coverage.

### Phase 8 – Re-enable Canonicalization Guards & E2E Tests
- **Goal:** Turn the skipped tests back on and demonstrate that illegal casts are resolved.
- **Work:**
  1. Gradually re-enable assertions in the map-recursive-union suite (constructor counts → wasm determinism → runtime execution).
  2. Re-enable `run-wasm-regression.e2e.test.ts` once `validate()` passes.
  3. Update `docs/type-canonicalization-pass.md` and the investigation log with final state, residual risks, and guidance.
  4. Remove TODOs/skips, run `npx vitest run` and `npm test`, and capture final wasm text snapshots for posterity.
- **Deliverables:** All suites green, wasm runtime validated, documentation refreshed.

## Supporting Notes
- Maintain `CANON_DEBUG` instrumentation through Phases 3–7 for surgical diagnostics; ensure it is silent when unset.
- Any temporary skips must reference the responsible phase so future contributors can clear them deliberately.
- Keep updating `docs/type-canonicalization-phase7-investigation.md` as phases progress—especially after union or optional constructor milestones.
